This is a Kotlin Multiplatform project targeting Android, iOS, Web.

My first project using Kotlin Multiplatform. Trying to learn about the structure, possbilities, and of course trying to develop a simple application, at least for Web and Android.

It's a simple restaurant "shop", displaying a list of articles (meals), create reservations after creating a basket.

I don't know if I will finish this projet. To completly finish my idea, I would also have to learn to develop an API, handle a database, manage an image storage... a lot of work and not enough free time...
